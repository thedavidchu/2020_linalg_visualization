# 2020_linalg_visualization
Visualization tools for linear algebra problems. Initially create for ECE367. If I continue to use it, then it is useful! If not, these are some of the visualization tools I used for the curriculum.

This code is not made to be 'efficient' in terms of running speed, but rather it is meant to be expressly educational and walk you through the steps.

## Files
- gradient_descent_plotter.py : plot the loss and accuracy for training, validation, and testing data gathered from gradient descent.
- plot3d.py : given a 2D function and domain, plot the function.
- polynomial_regression.py : given two vectors of (1) inputs and (2) outputs, it returns the Nth order polynomial approximation. I know this is redoing SciPy's library, but again, I repeat that this is meant to be educational rather than for performance.

## TODO
See TODO list inside each function.
- Of course, create a GUI to better interface with people
- It would be cool if I could host this on a website, but then I would have to rewrite this all in JavaScript, since I do not want to pay for a dynamic webpage. Or is there a way to run Python on a website another way? If there is a free way, please let me know!
